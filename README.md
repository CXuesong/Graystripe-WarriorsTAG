# _Warriors_ Text Adventure Game

A text adventure game inspired and loosely based on [_Warrior Cats_](http://warriorcats.com/).

This is a game book intended to be played with [Graystripe](https://github.com/CXuesong/Graystripe), a multi-lingual plain-text adventure game engine that is still in its experimental phase.

Perhaps the fun lies in the divergences of the hero's future made by our choices, step by step.
