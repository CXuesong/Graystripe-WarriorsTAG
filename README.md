# _Warriors_ Text Adventure Game

A text adventure game inspired and loosely based on [_Warrior Cats_](http://warriorcats.com/).

This is a game book intended to be played with ["Graystripe"](https://github.com/CXuesong/Graystripe), a multi-lingual plain-text adventure game engine that is still in its experimental phase.

To play the game, you may want to head for [the demo site of "Graystripe"](https://cxuesong.github.io/Graystripe/).

Perhaps the fun lies in the divergences of the hero's future made by our choices, step by step.

## How to collaborate

The gamebook is placed in the `docs` folder of this repository. You can either extend the storyline by editing _`GroupName`_`.json`, or contribute to the translations by editing _`GroupName`_`.`_`language`_.`json`. PR is welcomed.
